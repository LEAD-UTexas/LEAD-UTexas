<b><span style="font-size: 20px !important; color: #0055A9;">General information for applicants</span></b>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important;">Our lab investigates how the brain represents, processes, and regulates pain and emotions. Particularly, our research focuses on the development of clinically useful neuroimaging models and tools using machine learning and computational modeling approaches. Learn more about the lab by visiting our lab website (<a href="http://cocoanlab.github.io">http://cocoanlab.github.io</a>) or feel free to contact Dr. Choong-Wan Woo (<a href="mailto:waniwoo@skku.edu">waniwoo@skku.edu</a>).</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important;">Our lab is a part of the <a href="http://cnir.ibs.re.kr/html/cnir_en/">Center for Neuroscience Imaging Research (CNIR)</a> at <a href="https://www.ibs.re.kr">Institute for Basic Science (IBS)</a> in South Korea. Since the IBS is a government funding research institute, our lab will have stable funding for the next few years. Most importantly, our lab will have a full access to the CNIR’s brand-new neuroimaging <a href="http://cnir.ibs.re.kr/_prog/equipments/?&site_dvs_cd=cnir_en&menu_dvs_cd=050101">facilities and equipments</a> for conducting cutting-edge research. The facilities include animal and human MRIs (3T and 7T for human, 9.4T and 15.2T for animal), EEG, TMS, psychophysiological measures, two-photon microscope, super high-resolution confocal microscope, high performance computing clusters, electronic and machine shop, histology lab, and rodent and non-human primate animal housing. We are also getting a new 7T MRI soon. Our center and the lab have a strong emphasis on promoting an open, synergetic, multi-disciplinary, and creative research environment. Therefore, you will be able to experience active discussions and collaborations with other scientists from different fields of expertise.</span>

<p><span style="font-size: 15px !important;">To apply, please email Dr. Choong-Wan Woo (<a href="mailto:waniwoo@skku.edu">waniwoo@skku.edu</a>) with your CV and brief statement explaining your research interests as well as specific interests in joining the Computational Cognitive Affective Neuroscience Laboratory. </span></p>

<b><span style="font-size: 20px !important; color: #0055A9;">Postdoctoral fellow</span></b>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important;">Computational Cognitive Affective Neuroscience Laboratory (director: <a href="/people/#Wani">Dr. Choong-Wan Woo</a>) is seeking a talented postdoctoral fellow.</span>  

<span style="font-size: 15px !important;">Successful candidates should have Ph.D. in neuroscience, psychology, cognitive science, computer science, biomedical engineering, or related fields. Candidates should be highly motivated and also have a strong background in computational methods and neuroimaging experiment and data analysis. Computer programming skills (Matlab or Python; our lab is currently using Matlab) will be essential, and other analysis skills (e.g., machine learning, network analysis, computational modeling) and a good publication record will be greatly helpful. Having growth, innovation, collaborative mindsets will be crucial, and the ability to develop and express abstract ideas will be helpful. Writing skills are also important.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important;">Compensation will be competitive and commensurate with experience. Four major public insurances (national pension, health insurance, unemployment insurance, industrial accident) will be also supported.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important;">For those who are not living in South Korea and feel afraid of living in South Korea: South Korea has many beautiful places to visit and most importantly great food. Here are some helpful information and fun	 video clips:</span>

<b><span style="font-size: 20px !important; color: #0055A9;">Graduate Student</span></b>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important;">Computational Cognitive Affective Neuroscience Laboratory is accepting one or two talented graduate students (MS/PhD combined, but you can do MS only) through the Department of Biomedical Engineering in the Sungkyunkwan University. If you are interested in doing MS or PhD in the Cocoan lab, it might be good idea to email me in advance and work in the lab as a research assistant before you actually apply for the grad school. Joining the lab in advance will help with smoother transition to graduate student life.</span> 

<span style="font-size: 15px !important;">Successful candidates could have Bachelor's degree in neuroscience, psychology, biology, computer science, biomedical engineering, or related fields (but I'm quite open to other majors, so don't worry about the BS major). More importantly, successful candidates should show a strong motivation to do research, run experiments, publish your paper, and collaborate with other people in the lab. Experience in scientific research, computational modeling/analysis, coding, and neuroimaging will be a plus, but (again) if you have a strong motivation to learn these, it should be fine. Writing skills are important, so it would be very helpful if you could send me your writing samples. Having growth, innovative, and collaborative mindsets and the ability to develop and express abstract ideas will be crucial as well.</span> 

<span style="font-size: 15px !important;">You will receive a stipend and a support for tuition, but there are different rules for different cases (e.g., depending on PhD vs. MS, international students, scholarships, etc.). Thus, I will be able to provide more detailed information about the compensation when time comes. </span>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important;">If you are a senior-year undergrad student and consider to be a grad student in our lab, please read [this](/jobs/senior) before contacting me.

<b><span style="font-size: 20px !important; color: #0055A9;">Full-time Lab manager/Research assistant</span></b>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important;">Computational Cognitive Affective Neuroscience Laboratory is seeking a full-time lab manager/research assistant.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important;">Responsibilities include handling administrative duties for the lab (e.g., managing finances, purchasing equipment, recruiting and scheduling subjects, running experiments), supporting lab research (e.g., mentoring undergrad research assistants, maintaining lab equipments, assisting in data collection and analysis). You can also have the opportunity to conduct original research and publish research papers. This position is ideal for individuals interested in applying to graduate school or studying abroad.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important;">The successful candidate should have B.A./B.S. or M.A./M.S. in psychology, neuroscience, cognitive science, computer science, or a related field. Candidates should be independent and proactive workers who are able to learn new skills on their own, with strong organizational skills and a track record of working well with others in professional or extracurricular settings. Korean speakers are preferable. </span>

We usually ask for a commitment of at least 10 hours per week, and recommend attending our lab meeting (not required, though). You will be working closely with one or two researchers in the lab, and if you demonstrate good responsibility and dedication, you will have the opportunity to run original research. </span>  

<span style="font-size: 15px !important;">If you show a high level of responsibility and dedication, and prove to be helpful for the lab, you will be able to receive monthly compensation for your work in the lab. The paid undergrad RAs will be asked to show a commitment of at least 16 hours per week. In addition, the RA should have a specific project to actively work on.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important;">If you are interested in this job, please email Dr. Choong-Wan Woo (<a href="mailto:waniwoo@skku.edu">waniwoo@skku.edu</a>).</span>
